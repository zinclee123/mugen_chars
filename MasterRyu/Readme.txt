=====<Mode Overview>=====

This char has three different modes, here follows a short description:

<Normal Ryu>
- Can perform EX moves

<Evil Ryu>
- Has a better movelist
- Shouryuu Ken and Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku cause more hits on the opponent
- Shinkuu Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku draws in the opponent twice as fast as Ryu's

<Master Ryu>
- Is basically a mix between the first two modes, except he cannot use EX moves

Obs.: "Master Ryu" can more or less be understood for how Ryu would fight if Gouken didn't
tone down the Ansatsuken style and therefore teached him the Satsui no Hadou techniques.
But this is just a pretty explanation, the truth is I just wanted to add a mode with all of
both version's moves. =P
  Also, some people speculate he's the original SF1 Ryu (not his older brother from SF2) when
fighting without his shoes, which weigh about 60kg each to prevent himself from killing his
opponents with a single blow.



=====<.DEF and Pallet Overview>=====

This char has four different .def files, here's what each one does:
Pal No. 1 is light Punch, Pal. No.2 is Mid Punch, Pal No.3 is Heavy Punch
Pal No. 4 is light kick,  Pal. No.5 is mid kick,  Pal No.6 is Heavy Kick
Pal No. 7 is Start + light Punch.... Pal No. 12 is Heavy Kick + Start...

Select Pal beyond 12?
hold back when you the game is about to start. you can use light punch + back,
mid punch + back... etc

<RYU.def>
The mode is selected via palette:

Palettes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6	-> Normal Ryu
Palettes 7, 8, 10, 11		-> Evil Ryu

=====<Move Details>=====

- Sakotsu Wari is an overhead

- EX version of Ryu's Hadouken is the Shakunetsu Hadou Ken

- EX version of Joudan Sokutou Geri will make the opponent bounce off the wall

- Shinkuu Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku draws opponents towards you

- You can cancel Nidan Shouryuu Tsuki to Shin Shoryuken, if you successfully hit your opponent
with it and input its command just as Ryu connects the second hit. If successful Ryu will
flash white and switch to Shin Shoryuken. Be aware that this way it'll cause less damage than
a regular Shin Shoryuken

- Mashing any direction during Denjin or Metsu Hadouken will make Ryu charge it faster

- Some opponents are able to break out of Shun Goku Satsu, such as Gen or Gouki. However other
opponents may recieve extra damage, such as Vega (M.Bison) or Geese Howard (for more details,
check "Other Info"). To break out of Shun Goku Satsu, the victim must have more than half of
his life points and quickly mash any buttons;

- When Ryu fires the Ryuu Koku Hadou Ken, any opponent behind him will be blown away. Useful to
prevent getting hit out of the move while firing the beam.

- Normal and Master modes have extra taunts



=====<Other Info>=====

<Chars that have maximum resistance to Shun Goku Satsu>
   - Gen, Gouki, Mech Gouki, Pocket Shin Gouki, Shin Gouki and Soul Gen

<Chars that have medium resistance to Shun Goku Satsu>
   - Blaze Agent, Dark Sakura, Evil Ryu, God Rugal and Oyaji

<Chars that recieve 25% extra damage from Shun Goku Satsu>
   - Demitri, Jedah, Shadow DIO and Vega (M.Bison)
   - Geese Howard, Mukai, Orochi, Ryuji Yamazaki and Setsuna
   - Goro, Kintaro, Motaro, Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn
   - Dr. Doom
   - Mech Rugal, Omega Rugal and Rugal
   - Original Zero, Perfect Weapon MB-02, Sevil Nahte and Shadow Dio


More can be added here, so contact me if you know any and I'll consider it.
This list may be incomplete. Also, if you notice that this system isn't working with some char
please contact me so I can fix it.


<Selecting the win pose>
(Speech translations by Kibagami)

Normal/Master Ryu:
X, Y or Z -> Ryu raises his arm and says "Ore no kachi da!" ("Victory is mine!").
A, B or C -> Ryu crosses his arms and wind starts ruffling his clothes. There's a random chance
that a small leaf will appear, blown by the wind, or hold Start to see it.

Evil Ryu:
X, Y or Z -> Ryu turns his back and says "Shin no tsu, tometekureru!" ("I will stop your
heartbeat!").
A, B or C -> Ryu stomps the ground and says "Zetsu!" ("Death!").


<Extra win poses>

Normal Ryu:
Win by Shin Shoryuken -> Ryu turns his back on the opponent.

Evil Ryu:
Win by Ryuu Koku Hadou Ken -> Ryu falls on his knees, exhausted.
Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Ryu has his back turned, breathing heavily, saying "Ware, Kobushi
kiwame tari..." ("I mastered my fist...") while the Metsu kanji is displayed in the background.

Master mode has all of the above.
